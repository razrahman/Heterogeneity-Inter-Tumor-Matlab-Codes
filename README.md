# Heterogeneity-Inter-Tumor-Matlab-Codes
HARF is the main function.
Inputs are Genomic Characterizations of training samples and Drug Sensitivities of same drug for 2 cancer types and Testing samples.
Output is 2 column of predicted drug sensitivities using Heterogeneity Aware Random Forest (HARF), 
1st column is using classification procedure of HARF and 2nd column is using classification procedure of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
